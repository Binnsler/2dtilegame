Short-Term To-Do List

Goal:
Convert to mobile friendly and update all menus/inventory

Steps:
1. Convert to mobile-first by creating mobile controls and mobile-only styling ( 375 x 375 ), etc.
2. Scale on mobile ( canvas fills screen, controls fit nicely )
3. Update menus to change based on mobile vs. desktop. Desktop ( on top of canvas ), mobile ( beneath canvas )
4. Update inventory to new pattern ( tile-based, like Don't Starve )
5. Handle screen resizing, possibly landscape http://www.williammalone.com/articles/html5-game-scaling/
